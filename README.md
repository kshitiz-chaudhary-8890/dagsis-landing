### Principles

1. **Copy is data.** Components never hard-code marketing text; they read from `src/content`. Changing a headline is a one-file edit, and TypeScript catches missing fields.
2. **One section, one folder.** A section's helper components stay in its folder. Only truly reusable pieces go in `components/shared` or `components/ui`.
3. **Server components by default.** `"use client"` is only used where there's state or scroll/animation logic. Client components import content directly instead of receiving icon components as props, because functions can't be passed across the server/client boundary.
4. **Design tokens in one place.** Colours (`surface`, `ink-*`, `brand-*`, `night-*`) and keyframes live in `globals.css`. Neutrals are CSS variables that change under `.dark`.
5. **Motion is built from shared primitives** (see below) and always respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Light & dark theme

A sun/moon button in the navbar switches themes. The first visit follows the visitor's OS setting, and the choice is saved in `localStorage` (`dagsis-theme`).

| Piece | File |
|-------|------|
| Colour variables for both themes | `src/app/globals.css` (`:root` and `.dark`) |
| No-flash script, runs before paint | `src/lib/theme.ts` → injected in `src/app/layout.tsx` |
| Toggle button | `src/components/shared/ThemeToggle.tsx` |

**Rules for new components**
- Use the semantic tokens and **don't** add `dark:` variants for neutrals. They flip automatically:
  `bg-surface` (page), `bg-surface-raised` (cards), `text-ink-900` (strong text), `text-ink-500` (muted), `text-ink-400` (small meta text, still ≥ 4.5:1), `ring-ink-200` (borders).
- Main buttons use the logo blue in both themes (`Button` variant `primary`). **Avoid black:** don't use `bg-ink-950` / `bg-ink-900` as large backgrounds or buttons.
- For areas that stay dark in **both** themes (video section, pricing highlight, code blocks), use the fixed `night-*` palette (deep logo blues, not black), `bg-white`/`text-night-950` for white elements, and `text-white` / `text-white/60` for text. Don't use theme tokens inside them.
- Coloured text needs a dark-mode pair and a dark enough light shade: `text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-300`, `bg-emerald-100 dark:bg-emerald-500/15`.
- SVG strokes should use `currentColor` with an `ink-*` text class, not hex values.
- Images that show UI should come in light + dark versions (`src` + `srcDark`).

## Logo

The official artwork is kept in `design/brand/Final Dagsis Logo/` (full-size PNGs, **not** deployed; `public/` would make 7 MB of source files downloadable).
The site uses small copies made from it:

| File | Made from | Used in |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `public/brand/dagsis-mark.png` | `1926.png` (mark, transparent) | Navbar, integrations orb |
| `public/brand/dagsis-wordmark-light.png` / `-dark.png` | `1924.png` "Dagsis.ai" text (dark version: navy text → white) | Navbar |
| `public/brand/dagsis-logo-light.png` / `-dark.png` | `1924.png` full lock-up with tagline | Footer |
| `src/app/favicon.ico`, `src/app/icon.png` | `1926.png` | Browser tab icon |
| `src/app/apple-icon.png` | `1926.png` on white | iOS home screen |
| `src/app/opengraph-image.png` | `1924.png` on white, 1200×630 | Link previews (WhatsApp, Slack, X…) |

All logo rendering goes through `components/shared/Logo.tsx` (`<Logo />` compact, `<Logo variant="full" />`, `<LogoMark />`). To update the logo, replace these files (same names and similar proportions), or regenerate them from new artwork.

## Motion

Motion follows the reference sites (mostly built in Framer, with Lenis smooth scroll on youratlas and joinboardly).

| Section | Motion | Reference | Built with |
|---------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Whole page | Inertial smooth scrolling | youratlas, joinboardly | `layout/SmoothScroll.tsx` (Lenis) |
| Hero | Headline words rise in one by one; agent panel plays sample chats (question → typing → answer) | youratlas | CSS `animate-word-in`, `HeroAgentCard` |
| Problem | As the section arrives the left column builds in from the left: accent line + label, headline word by word (slide + un-blur), description, then a "Support inbox" illustration. The section then pins: problem cards slide in from the right while matching inbox rows slide in from the left, and the unanswered counter / waiting timer climb with scroll. Mobile: heading and inbox from the left, cards from the right | joinboardly / Intercom-style scroll storytelling | `Problem` (`enter` + `pin`), `ProblemInbox`, `ProblemItem`, content in `content/problem.ts` (`problemInbox`) |
| Use cases | Sticky cards that stack while scrolling (big gradient numerals, WhatsApp chat per use case); covered cards shrink and dim | cevver | `UseCases` + `useScrollProgress` |
| Video | Player grows to full size as it arrives | Framer sites | `VideoSection` |
| Features | Frosted cards on logo-colour gradients alternate with a product scene per feature. Ticker glides left at 25 px/s, eases to 10% speed on hover, drag / sideways-scroll to browse (measured from the reference) | dagis.framer.website | `Marquee` |
| Product tour | Section pins; each scroll step swings the active 16:9 card out to the left in 3D while the next turns in from top-right; a Dagsis bubble types then confirms the next stop; titles blur in/out. The front card is a link (↗ button on the image + ↗ on the title; hover zooms the image and fills the button blue); set `href` per tab in `content/showcase.ts` (default: Book a Demo) | anubi.io | `ProductShowcase`, `TourBubble` |
| Deploy | Pills pop in; dots travel along the connectors; arc rotates round the orb | youratlas | `ChannelHub` (SVG `animateMotion`) |
| Why Dagsis | Cards stagger in; each illustration plays once in view (bubbles appear, timeline dots pop, reply bars grow, checklist ticks); cards lift on hover | – | `WhyDagsis`, `WhyVisuals` |
| Testimonial | Quote brightens word by word | joinboardly | `ScrollRevealText` |
| FAQ | Smooth open/close | joinboardly | `.faq-item` in globals.css |
| Everything else | Fade up when scrolled into view | – | `Reveal` |

**Adding motion to a new section:** use `Reveal` for entrances. For scroll-linked effects, use `useScrollProgress(ref, mode)` with `range()` / `lerp()` / `easeOut()`, and fall back to the end state when `useReducedMotion()` is true.

---

## Visual style guidelines

The site should read as designed by people, not generated. Keep it that way:
- **Colour:** taken from the Dagsis.ai logo. Neutrals are navy-tinted (`ink-950` = wordmark navy `#030d26`), the accent is the ".ai" blue (`brand-500` = `#3171f3`), and `logo-cyan` / `logo-deep` come from the mark. **No purple and no black.** Primary buttons and highlights are the logo blue; dark blocks use deep blues (`night-*`). No glowing blur blobs or grid textures.
- **Type:** Instrument Sans for UI; Instrument Serif *italic* for the accent part of a headline (`titleAccent`).
- **Section labels:** plain text (`Eyebrow`), not pills with dots.
- **Layout rhythm:** mix `align="center"`, `"left"` and `"split"` headers; not every section is a centred title over a card grid.
- **Copy:** specific and plain. Avoid em dashes, "supercharge / seamless / unlock / elevate", and unverifiable numbers.

## Page sections & references

| # | Section | Reference | How it follows the reference |
|---|---------|-----------|------------------------------|

## Placeholder media

All images and the video in `public/` are **placeholders generated from the coded mock-ups**, so the site ships with real files in the right places.

**To use real media, replace the files and keep the names.**

| File | Used by |
|------|---------|
| `public/images/showcase/<tab>-light.webp` / `-dark.webp` (tabs: knowledge, builder, widget, conversations, analytics) | Product showcase (`content/showcase.ts`) |
| `public/images/features/bg-*.jpg`, `photo-*.jpg` | Feature ticker backgrounds and people photos (`content/features.ts`). **Taken from the Dagsis Framer draft (dagis.framer.website)**: confirm licensing or replace |
| `public/videos/product-walkthrough.mp4` | Video section (`siteConfig.links.productVideo`) |
| `public/images/video-poster.webp` | Video poster (`siteConfig.links.productVideoPoster`) |

If the new screenshots have a different pixel size, update `width`/`height` in `content/showcase.ts`. A YouTube/Vimeo embed URL also works for `productVideo`.

**Regenerating the placeholders** (after changing the mock-ups): run `npm run dev`, then `npm run media:placeholders` in a second terminal. The script uses your installed Chrome (set `CHROME_PATH` if it isn't found) and a bundled ffmpeg, and it clears the `next/image` cache afterwards.

> **Replacing an image with a file of the same name?** `next/image` may keep serving the cached old version. Delete `.next/cache/images` (and `.next/dev/cache/images` while developing) or restart with a fresh build.

---

## Common tasks

**Change copy.** Edit the matching file in `src/content/`.

**Reorder, add, or remove a section.** Edit `src/app/(site)/page.tsx`. To add a new section:
1. Add `src/content/my-section.ts` (plus types in `types/content.ts` if needed) and export it from `content/index.ts`.
2. Create `src/components/sections/my-section/MySection.tsx` using `<Section>` and `<SectionHeader>`.
3. Export it from `components/sections/index.ts` and place it in `page.tsx`.
4. To link it from the navbar, give the `<Section id="...">` an id and add it to `content/navigation.ts`.

**Turn on social proof.** Add logos to `public/images/logos/`, fill in `content/trusted-by.ts`, and set `featureFlags.showTrustedBy = true`.

**Rebrand colours.** Change the `brand` values in `src/app/globals.css`. Tints 50–200 are set per theme in `:root` / `.dark`, and 300–950 are in `@theme`.
